Logic GATES are an important part of digital electronics
------> They are used to create boolean expressions.
-------> Logic gates are fundamental building blocks of digital electronic circuits. 
-------->They are used to perform logical operations on binary numbers, 
which consist of 0s and 1s. These gates are crucial in digital electronics for several reasons :
They serve as building blocks for creating complex circuits, enabling the manipulation and processing of digital information based on Boolean algebra.
How Do Logic Gates Work?
AND Gate:

Output is high (1) only when both inputs are high (1).
OR Gate:

Output is high (1) when at least one input is high (1).
NOT Gate:

Inverts the input; output is high (1) when input is low (0) and vice versa.
NAND Gate:

Output is low (0) only when both inputs are high (1).
NOR Gate:

Output is low (0) when at least one input is high (1).
XOR Gate:

Output is high (1) when the number of high inputs is odd.

1. Digital Alarm Clock:
Logic Gate Used: AND Gate, OR Gate
Example: An alarm clock uses logic gates to check whether the current time matches the preset alarm time. An AND gate may be used to check if both the alarm is enabled and the current time matches the preset time, triggering the alarm if true.
2. Elevator Control System:
Logic Gate Used: AND Gate, OR Gate
Example: In an elevator control system, logic gates help determine if the elevator doors should open or close based on inputs such as the position of the elevator, user inputs, and safety conditions.
3. Traffic Light Control System:
Logic Gate Used: AND Gate, OR Gate
Example: Logic gates are used to control traffic lights. For instance, an AND gate might be used to ensure that the green light is only on when both the pedestrian signal is not active and there is no conflicting traffic.
4. Digital Thermometer:
Logic Gate Used: AND Gate, Comparator
Example: In a digital thermometer, logic gates are used to compare the measured temperature with a preset threshold. An AND gate may be employed to activate an alert if the temperature is both above a certain level and has been sustained for a specified duration.
5. Automated Washing Machine:
Logic Gate Used: AND Gate, OR Gate
Example: Logic gates in a washing machine control various functions such as water level, cycle selection, and spin speed. For instance, an AND gate might ensure that the spin cycle only activates when the lid is closed and the water has drained.
